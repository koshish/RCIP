## Abstract
>News and reviews impact almost everyone in making day-to-day choices. Our lifestyle and consuming habits are derived from information we collect as we grow up. Besides family, friends, school and workplace, one of the most influential source is "News Media".  News and Reviews affect our perception, our choice of clothes, our food, our movies, our career and more. Because of ease access to internet in these days, news media can easily reach out massive population and manipulate the information. This makes our lifestyle and consuming habits depend on trust of news and media companies. Plus, we all know about paid promotion, paid news and fake reviews. Hence the system is broken and unfair. To solve this, we are proposing a decentralized and trustless news portal system where all news contents are reviewed and validated in decentralized fashion. Writers, validators, developers, liquidity providers, influencers, treasury are rewarded with dual token system (governance Review Capital Token (RECAP) and utility token (to be named) based on their quality of task. No more advertised news & no more paid news.

## Introduction
News industry is one of the most influential market with biggest user count and advertisements revenue. Bringing news industry into blockchain system will decentralize both contents and ad revenue.

## Decentralized News Portal System
Review Capital focuses on building decentralized news portal built on Zilliqa blockchain. It runs on censorship-resistant mechanism on IPFS and gets integrated with ZRC-2 protocal. News articles on this platform are published, validated and circulated without any central authority. Even the advertisement placement goes through decentralized community decision. This will mimick the traditonal news industry into complete end-to-end blockchain system.

* News Submission Process: Anyone can submit news and track it in smart contract regarding publication, trust score and earnings.
* News Publication Process: Anyone can become a validator and participates in news publication process in decentralized way with IPFS.
* News Validation Process: Community will set up standards based on voting to validate all news with governance portal.
* Advertisement Submission Process: Anyone can submit advertisements of any kind.
* Advertisement Placement Process: Validators participate in selection and approval of advertisements similar to news articles.
* Reward Distribution Process: Smart Contract distributes the rewards to eligible participants.



## Tokenomics of RECAP
Review Capital will be governed by RECAP token with max supply of 11 millions RECAP tokens. RECAP is a ZRC-2 compliant fungible token which will primarily act as a governance token to provide incentive to all liquidity pools of Review Capital network, protocol developers and treasury. 10k RECAP tokens are minted per rewards cycle until the supply of 11 millions RECAP lasts. Reward minting triggers at the end of epoch. 

Tokens are distributed in the ratio of 6:2:2 among Liquidity Pool, Protocol Developers and Treasury. There will be no tokens minted until the end of epoch.

Max supply cap = 11 million RECAP <br>
Decimals = 12<br>
1 epoch = 1 week = 1 cycle<br>
Minting phase = 2 (Initial & Live phases)<br>
Initial Minting phase mints 200,000 RECAP only<br>
Live Minting phase mints 10,000 RECAP each epoch until 11,000,000th RECAP<br>
Distribution: 60% : 20% : 20% for liquidity provider\/protocol developer\/treasury<br>

<b><br>Initial Minting</br></b>

There will an initial minting of 200k RECAP token to kickstart the beta phase of project. <br>
100k RECAP will be used to provide liquidity in Zilswap.<br>
Remaining 100K RECAP will be distributed for beta Writers, beta Validators and developers. <br>

| Phases             | Involved Parties               | Token Supply (RECAP)  | Percentage Own | Phase Period            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ----------------------| :-----------:  | :---------------------: |
| Minting - Initial  | Beta Phase Development         | 100,000               |      50%       | Token Deployment.       | 
| Minting - Initial  | Zilswap Liquidity              | 100,000               |      50%       | Token Deployment.       |


Once project goes live with validator app and governance, remaining 10.8 million RECAP tokens are minted based on reward cycle.


| Phases             | Involved Parties               | Token Supply (RECAP)         | Percentage Own |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- | :-----------:  |
| Minting - Live     | Liquidity Prviders             | 6,000 per week reward cycle  |      60%       |
| Minting - Live     | Protocol Developers            | 2,000 per week reward cycle  |      20%       |
| Minting - Live     | Treasury (Grant)               | 2,000 per week reward cycle  |      20%       |
|                    |                                |                              |                |                         
|                    | Max Supply                     | 11,000,000                   |     100%       |                         

When the max supply hits 11,000,000 RECAP tokens, network will run only on revenue generated through various Review Capital newtork projects .


## Community Ecosystem of RECAP
* Liquidity Providers: Anyone who provides liquidity to the governance token (RECAP) and/or to the utility tokens of Review Capital network.
* Protocol Developers: Anyone who is a member of core team working on RECAP protocol is called Developer. Reward received in developer wallet is used for growth of RECAP ecosystem.
* Treasury: Rewards received in the Treasury (Grant) will be utilized to provide grants.

## Tokenomics of Utility Token
Utilities of news portals will be driven by "Utility" token that mints max supply of 10,000 Tokens per Epoch and burns 100% of all collected fees. This "Utility" token is a ZRC-2 compliant fungible token which will primarily act as a reward incentives to news writers, validators, protocol developers and treasury (grants). It costs 1 Utility token to submit an article and 10 Utility tokens to submit an advertisement. Maximum of 10,000 Utility tokens are minted per rewards cycle. Reward minting triggers at the end of epoch. These newly minted Utility tokens are distributed to writers, validators, developers and treasury (grants). News writers get reward based on Trust Score of news & validators get reward based on their Profile Score.

Tokens are distributed in the ratio of 3:3:2:2 among Writers, Validators, Developers, Treasury. There will be no tokens minted until the end of epoch.

Max supply cap = 10,000 Utility token per epoch <br>
Decimals = 12<br>
1 epoch = 1 week = 1 cycle<br>
Minting phase = 2 (Initial & Live phases)<br>
Initial Minting phase mints 4,000,000 Utility tokens only<br>
Live Minting phase mints each epoch based on Trust Score and Profile Score without exceeding the maximum minting of 10,000 Utility Token<br>
Distribution: 30% : 30% : 20% : 20% for writer\/validator\/developer\/treasury<br>

Cost fee of article submission = 1 Utility Token (changes with governance voting)<br>
Cost fee of article validation = 0.1 Utility Token (changes with governance voting)
Max reward per cycle = 10 Utility token per article ( 10 token per article gets distributed at the end of the cycle amongst writers (based on Trust score of article), validators (based on profile score), protocol developers, treasury)<br>

<b><br>Initial Minting</br></b>

There will an initial minting of 4,000,000 Utility tokens to kickstart the project. <br>
3,000,000 Utility token will be sold to public through ZILO.<br>
Remaining 1,000,000 Utility token will be kept in Zilswap liquidity pool.<br>

| Phases             | Involved Parties               | Token Supply (Utility Token)  | Percentage Own | Phase Period            |

## Community Ecosystem
* News Writers: Anyone who submits news or articles or contents for publication is called News Writer. Each news writer gets reward based on Trust Score of news article.
>Trust Score: Trust score is a percentage value assigned to each article after curation from Validators. A news article with less than 50% Trust Score does not qualify for rewards. Validation are randomly push over to sample population of active validators for Publication Check, Evidence Check, Quality Check and Impact Check.

* Validators: Anyone who participates in validation of news content and advertisements is called Validator. Each validator gets reward based on Profile Score.
>Profile Score: Profile score is a percentage value assigned to each validator after completion of validation task. A validator with less than 50% Profile Score does not qualify for rewards of that article. 

* Protocol Developers: Anyone who is a member of core team working on Utility Token protocol is called Developer. Reward received in developer wallet is used for growth of Utility Token ecosystem.

## Utilities of Utility Token	
a) Articles submission.<br>
b) Appeal submission.<br>
c) Ads submission.<br>

## Revenue of Utility Network	
Article submission fee = 1 Utility Token (changes with governance voting)<br>
Ads submission fee = 10 Utility Token (changes with governance voting)<br>
Appeal submission fee = 10 Utility Token (changes with governance voting)<br>
Ad revenue = varies (in any ZRC token + ZIL accepted)<br>
Validation Submission Fee = 0.1 Utility Token (changes with governance voting)<br>
Revenue distribution = 30% to Writers, 30% to Validators, 20% to Developers, 20% to Treasury<br>
Token Burning = 100% of the token collected as a fee through article subission and validation submission will be burned at the end of epoch.

## Reward Mechanism
<i><b>Rules of Utility Token distribution</i></b><br>	
a) Writers get rewards based on Trust Score of each article.<br> 
b) Validators get rewards based on their Profile Score.<br>
c) Developers get rewards as grant for development.<br>
d) Treasury rewards will be utilized to provide grants.<br>

Since Utility tokens are rewarded to 4 parties: News Writers, Validators, Protocol Developers, and Treasury (grants) there exists a distribution mechanism for fairness.<br>

<i><b>Rewards of writers based on trust score of news articles</i></b><br>
All submitted news articles are validated and assigned a final Trust Score within 1 days. Trust Score for any news article is a percentage score ranging from 0 to 100. News article with less than 50% Trust Score does not qualify for rewards. To be eligible for rewards, following 2 conditions must met:<br>
a) It must have Trust Score of more than 50%.<br>
b) Cycle Reward Distribution is triggered at the end of reward cycle.<br>

Article's reward = 0.3\*{(Trust Score of an article)\/(Total Trust Score of that Cycle)}\*Tokens to be minted in that epoch Utility Token<br>
Eligibility = 50% or more Trust Score + Status: Validation Completed<br>                                
Reward cycle = 1 week <br>

<i><b>Rewards of validators based on profile score</i></b><br>
Any wallet can become a Validator. When news articles are submitted, they are randomly sent out for validation among a sample pool of Validators. Each validation expires within 24 hours or 100% validation response. If "Publication Check" fails for any article, it gets instantly removed from platform. Other validations includes "Evidence Check", "Quality Check" and "Impact Check".<br>

While these checks build up a "Trust Score" for a news article, the accuracy of validation makes Profile Score for a validator. A validator can miss the task or may provide validation which falls either in majority or minority. Based on these factors, profile score is maintained for each eligible wallet. When cycle rewards are minted, only validators, whose Profile Score is 50% or more, are eligible to receive Utility tokens.

Cycle Validator's reward = 0.3*\{(Profile Score of a validator)\/(Total Profile Score of that Cycle)}\*Tokens to be minted in that Epoch Utility Token<br>
Eligibility = 0.01 Utility Token Fees; More than 50% Profile Score + Status: Active <br>

If there is no validator wallet in any of the group, the allocated rewards goes to Treasury (grant) wallet to randomly reward community events based on community vote.


<i><b>Rewards for Utility Token Protocol Developers</i></b><br>
Core team members of the Utility Token project are considered as the Utility Token protocol developers.

Reward for utility Token Protocol Developers = 0.2\* Tokens to be minted in that epoch Utility Token 

<i><b>Utility Token Treasury</i></b><br>
Certain amount of Utility Token in each epoch goes to treasury, which can be used for the growth of the community and to cover expenses such as grants,operating cost, marketing, development, etc.

Utility Token Treasury = 0.2\* Tokens to be minted in that epoch Utility Token <br>

Any excess tokens will be kept in Treasury.

## Roadmap
>The brainstorming on this idea of decentralized news portal happened in March 2020 between Krishna & Anil. Initially the plan was to work on "Reviews" sector but later the team pivoted and focused on News sector. Between March 2020 and Feb 2021, a lot of paperworks and documentations were done. To build a working prototype, team decided to fork DASH blockchain and implement all the changes to fit RECAP ecosystem. With this successful prototype, we have a lot of plans ahead to launch on Zilliqa mainnet and achieive various milestones.
