## Abstract
>News and reviews impact almost everyone in making day-to-day choices. Our lifestyle and consuming habits are derived from information we collect as we grow up. Besides family, friends, school and workplace, one of the most influential source is "News Media".  News and Reviews affect our perception, our choice of clothes, our food, our movies, our career and more. Because of ease access to internet in these days, news media can easily reach out massive population and manipulate the information. This makes our lifestyle and consuming habits depend on trust of news and media companies. Plus, we all know about paid promotion, paid news and fake reviews. Hence the system is broken and unfair. To solve this, we are proposing a decentralized and trustless news portal system where all news contents are reviewed and validated in decentralized fashion. Writers, validators, developers, liquidity providers, influencers, treasury are rewarded with dual token system (governance Review Capital Token (RECAP) and utility token (to be named) based on their quality of task. No more advertised news & no more paid news.

## Introduction
News industry is one of the most influential market with biggest user count and advertisements revenue. Bringing news industry into blockchain system will decentralize both contents and ad revenue.

## Decentralized News Portal System
Review Capital focuses on building decentralized news portal built on Zilliqa blockchain. It runs on censorship-resistant mechanism on IPFS and gets integrated with ZRC-2 protocal. News articles on this platform are published, validated and circulated without any central authority. Even the advertisement placement goes through decentralized community decision. This will mimick the traditonal news industry into complete end-to-end blockchain system.

* News Submission Process: Anyone can submit news and track it in smart contract regarding publication, trust score and earnings.
* News Publication Process: Anyone can become a validator and participates in news publication process in decentralized way with IPFS.
* News Validation Process: Community will set up standards based on voting to validate all news with governance portal.
* Advertisement Submission Process: Anyone can submit advertisements of any kind.
* Advertisement Placement Process: Validators participate in selection and approval of advertisements similar to news articles.
* Reward Distribution Process: Smart Contract distributes the rewards to eligible participants.


## Tokenomics of RECAP
Review Capital will be governed by RECAP token with max supply of 11 millions RECAP tokens. RECAP is a ZRC-2 compliant fungible token which will primarily act as a governance token to provide incentive to all liquidity pools of Review Capital network, protocol developers and treasury. 10k RECAP tokens are minted per rewards cycle until the supply of 11 millions RECAP lasts. Reward minting triggers at the end of epoch. 

Tokens are distributed in the ratio of 6:2:2 among Liquidity Pool, Protocol Developers and Treasury. There will be no tokens minted until the end of epoch.

Max supply cap = 11 million RECAP <br>
Decimals = 12<br>
1 epoch = 1 week = 1 cycle<br>
Minting phase = 2 (Initial & Live phases)<br>
Initial Minting phase mints 200,000 RECAP only<br>
Live Minting phase mints 10,000 RECAP each epoch until 11,000,000th RECAP<br>
Distribution: 60% : 20% : 20% for liquidity provider\/protocol developer\/treasury<br>

<b><br>Initial Minting</br></b>

There will an initial minting of 200k RECAP token to kickstart the beta phase of project. <br>
100k RECAP will be used to provide liquidity in Zilswap.<br>
Remaining 100K RECAP will be distributed for beta Writers, beta Validators and developers. <br>

| Phases             | Involved Parties               | Token Supply (RECAP)  | Percentage Own | Phase Period            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ----------------------| :-----------:  | :---------------------: |
| Minting - Initial  | Beta Phase Development         | 100,000               |      50%       | Token Deployment.       | 
| Minting - Initial  | Zilswap Liquidity              | 100,000               |      50%       | Token Deployment.       |


Once project goes live with validator app and governance, remaining 10.8 million RECAP tokens are minted based on reward cycle.


| Phases             | Involved Parties               | Token Supply (RECAP)         | Percentage Own |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- | :-----------:  |
| Minting - Live     | Liquidity Prviders             | 6,000 per week reward cycle  |      60%       |
| Minting - Live     | Protocol Developers            | 2,000 per week reward cycle  |      20%       |
| Minting - Live     | Treasury (Grant)               | 2,000 per week reward cycle  |      20%       |
|                    |                                |                              |                |                         
|                    | Max Supply                     | 11,000,000                   |     100%       |                         

When the max supply hits 11,000,000 RECAP tokens, network will run only on revenue generated through various Review Capital newtork projects .


## Community Ecosystem of RECAP
* Liquidity Providers: Anyone who provides liquidity to the governance token (RECAP) and/or to the utility tokens of Review Capital network.
* Protocol Developers: Anyone who is a member of core team working on RECAP protocol is called Developer. Reward received in developer wallet is used for growth of RECAP ecosystem.
* Treasury: Rewards received in the Treasury (Grant) will be utilized to provide grants.

## Utilities of RECAP	
a) Governance Voting (Voting power 1:1 ratio i.e 1 vote for 1 RECAP).<br>
b) Revenue Distribution.<br>
c) Rewards Distribution.<br>
d) Grant Distribution.<br>
e) Advertisement Currency.<br>
f) Zilswap RECAP-ZIL and Utility token - ZIL pool.<br>


## Revenue of RECAP Network	
Ad revenue = varies (in any ZRC token + ZIL accepted)<br>
Revenue distribution = 60% to Liquidity Providers, 20% to Protocol Developers, 20% to Treasury<br>

## Reward Mechanism
<i><b>Rules of RECAP distribution</i></b><br>	
a) Liquidity providers get rewards based on their holding shares in RECAP liquidity pool.<br>
b) Developers get rewards as grant for development.<br>
c) Treasury rewards will be utilized to provide grants.<br>

<i><b>Rewards for RECAP Liquidity Providers</i></b><br>
Any RECAP holder who provides liquidity to the liquidity pool of RECAP-ZIL pool and Utility Token - ZIL pool will be eligible to get LP reward.

Liquidity Provider's reward for Zilswap RECAP-ZIL Pool= (% holding share of liquidity pool)\*3000 RECAP each Epoch<br>
Liquidity Provider's reward for Zilswap Utility Token-ZIL Pool= (% holding share of liquidity pool)\*3000 RECAP each Epoch<br>

Any unutilized tokens will be kept in Treasury.

<i><b>Rewards for RECAP Protocol Developers</i></b><br>
Core team members of the Review Capital project are considered as the RECAP protocol developers.

Reward for RECAP Protocol Developers = 2,000 RECAP per Epoch

<i><b>RECAP Treasury</i></b><br>
Certain amount of RECAP in each epoch goes to treasury, which can be used for the growth of the community and to cover expenses such as grants,operating cost, marketing, development, etc.

Treasury = 2000 RECAP each epoch<br>

## Roadmap
>The brainstorming on this idea of decentralized news portal happened in March 2020 between Krishna & Anil. Initially the plan was to work on "Reviews" sector but later the team pivoted and focused on News sector. Between March 2020 and Feb 2021, a lot of paperworks and documentations were done. To build a working prototype, team decided to fork DASH blockchain and implement all the changes to fit RECAP ecosystem. With this successful prototype, we have a lot of plans ahead to launch on Zilliqa mainnet and achieive various milestones.
